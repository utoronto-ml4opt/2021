### Algorithm Configuration for a MIP Solver
Perform a small to medium-scale computational study of algorithm configuration (see Lecture 4) for a MIP or MIP-based solver. A "MIP solver" here refers to tools such as SCIP, Gurobi, CPLEX, Xpress, i.e., tools for solving Mixed Integer Linear Programs (deterministic, single-objective). A "MIP-based solver" may be a software tool (that you implement or that is available in open-source or free for academic use) for tackling integer optimization problems beyond the linear/single-objective/deterministic case, for example the many projects from [Coin-OR](https://www.coin-or.org/projects/).

Compare some of the following approaches on one or more datasets (of optimization instances), controlling a subset of parameters which you think are interesting (e.g., branching parameters, preprocessing parameters, etc.):
- Default parameter setting;
- A solver's own parameter tuning tool (if any);
- Random sampling of parameter configuration;
- An advanced algorithm configuration tool, e.g., [ParamILS](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/beta/Projects/ParamILS/), [SMAC](https://automl.github.io/SMAC3/master/).

Use best practices for analyzing experimental results (see Lecture 3).
